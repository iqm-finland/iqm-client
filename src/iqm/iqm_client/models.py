class Instruction(BaseModel):
    r"""

    The :class:`Instruction` class represents a native quantum operation.

    Different Instruction types are distinguished by their :attr:`~Instruction.name`.
    Each Instruction type acts on a number of :attr:`~Instruction.qubits`, and expects certain
    :attr:`~Instruction.args`.

    We currently support the following native instruction types:

    ================ =========== ====================================== ===========
    name             # of qubits args                                   description
    ================ =========== ====================================== ===========
    measure          >= 1        ``key: str``                           Measurement in the Z basis.
    prx              1           ``angle_t: float``, ``phase_t: float`` Phased x-rotation gate.
    cz               2                                                  Controlled-Z gate.
    barrier          >= 1                                               Execution barrier.
    move             2                                                  Moves 1 state between resonator and qubit.
    ================ =========== ====================================== ===========

    For each Instruction you may also optionally specify :attr:`~Instruction.implementation`,
    which contains the name of an implementation of the instruction to use.
    Support for multiple implementations is currently experimental and in normal use the
    field should be omitted, this selects the default implementation for the instruction.

    .. note::

        The following instruction names are deprecated, but supported for backwards compatibility for now:

    * ``phased_rx`` ↦ ``prx``
    * ``measurement`` ↦ ``measure``

    Measure
    -------

    Measurement in the computational (Z) basis. The measurement results are the output of the circuit.
    Takes one string argument, ``key``, denoting the measurement key the results are labeled with.
    All the measurement keys in a circuit must be unique. Each qubit may only be measured once.
    The measurement must be the last operation on each qubit, i.e. it cannot be followed by gates.

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Example

        Instruction(name='measure', qubits=('alice', 'bob', 'charlie'), args={'key': 'm1'})

    PRX
    ---

    Phased x-rotation gate, i.e. an x-rotation conjugated by a z-rotation.
    Takes two arguments, the rotation angle ``angle_t`` and the phase angle ``phase_t``,
    both measured in units of full turns (:math:`2\pi` radians).
    The gate is represented in the standard computational basis by the matrix

    .. math::
        \text{PRX}(\theta, \phi) = \exp(-i (X \cos (2 \pi \; \phi) + Y \sin (2 \pi \; \phi)) \: \pi \; \theta)
        = \text{RZ}(\phi) \: \text{RX}(\theta) \: \text{RZ}^\dagger(\phi),

    where :math:`\theta` = ``angle_t``, :math:`\phi` = ``phase_t``,
    and :math:`X` and :math:`Y` are Pauli matrices.

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Example

        Instruction(name='prx', qubits=('bob',), args={'angle_t': 0.7, 'phase_t': 0.25})

    CZ
    --

    Controlled-Z gate. Represented in the standard computational basis by the matrix

    .. math:: \text{CZ} = \text{diag}(1, 1, 1, -1).

    It is symmetric wrt. the qubits it's acting on, and takes no arguments.

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Example

        Instruction(name='cz', qubits=('alice', 'bob'), args={})

    MOVE
    ----

    The MOVE operation is a unitary population exchange operation between a qubit and a resonator.
    Its effect is only defined in the invariant subspace :math:`S = \text{span}\{|00\rangle, |01\rangle, |10\rangle\}`,
    where it swaps the populations of the states :math:`|01\rangle` and :math:`|10\rangle`.
    Its effect on the orthogonal subspace is undefined.

    MOVE has the following presentation in the subspace :math:`S`:

    .. math:: \text{MOVE}_S = |00\rangle \langle 00| + a |10\rangle \langle 01| + a^{-1} |01\rangle \langle 10|,

    where :math:`a` is an undefined complex phase that is canceled when the MOVE gate is applied a second time.

    To ensure that the state of the qubit and resonator has no overlap with :math:`|11\rangle`, it is
    recommended that no single qubit gates are applied to the qubit in between a
    pair of MOVE operations.

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Example

        Instruction(name='move', qubits=('alice', 'resonator'), args={})

    Barrier
    -------

    A barrier instruction affects the physical execution order of the instructions elsewhere in the
    circuit that act on qubits spanned by the barrier.
    It ensures that any such instructions that succeed the barrier are only executed after
    all such instructions that precede the barrier have been completed.
    Hence it can be used to guarantee a specific causal order for the other instructions.
    It takes no arguments, and has no other effect.

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Example

        Instruction(name='barrier', qubits=('alice', 'bob'), args={})

    *Note*
    1-qubit barriers will not have any effect on circuit's compilation and execution. Higher layers
    that sit on top of IQM Client can make actual use of 1-qubit barriers (e.g. during circuit optimization),
    therefore having them is allowed.
