    This class represents a native quantum operation

    ================ =========== ======================================= ===========

    For each Instruction you may also optionally specify :attr:`~Instruction.implementation`,
    which contains the name of an implementation of the operation to use.
    Support for multiple implementations is currently experimental and in normal use the
    field should be omitted, this selects the default implementation for the operation for that locus.

    Measure
    -------

    Measurement in the computational (Z) basis. The measurement results are the output of the circuit.
    Takes two string arguments: ``key``, denoting the measurement key the returned results are labeled with,
    and ``feedback_key``, which is only needed if the measurement result is used for classical control
    within the circuit.
    All the measurement keys and feedback keys used in a circuit must be unique (but the two groups of
    keys are independent namespaces).
    Each qubit may be measured multiple times, i.e. mid-circuit measurements are allowed.

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Example

        Instruction(name='measure', qubits=('alice', 'bob', 'charlie'), args={'key': 'm1'})

    PRX
    ---

    Phased x-rotation gate, i.e. an x-rotation conjugated by a z-rotation.
    Takes two arguments, the rotation angle ``angle_t`` and the phase angle ``phase_t``,
    both measured in units of full turns (:math:`2\pi` radians).
    The gate is represented in the standard computational basis by the matrix

    .. math::
        \text{PRX}(\theta, \phi) = \exp(-i (X \cos (2 \pi \; \phi) + Y \sin (2 \pi \; \phi)) \: \pi \; \theta)
        = \text{RZ}(\phi) \: \text{RX}(\theta) \: \text{RZ}^\dagger(\phi),

    where :math:`\theta` = ``angle_t``, :math:`\phi` = ``phase_t``,
    and :math:`X` and :math:`Y` are Pauli matrices.

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Example

        Instruction(name='prx', qubits=('bob',), args={'angle_t': 0.7, 'phase_t': 0.25})

    CC_PRX
    ------

    Classically controlled PRX gate. Takes four arguments. ``angle_t`` and ``phase_t`` are exactly as in PRX.
    ``feedback_key`` is a string that identifies the ``measure`` instruction whose result controls
    the gate (the one that shares the feedback key).
    ``feedback_qubit`` is the name of the physical qubit within the ``measure`` instruction that produces the feedback.
    If the measurement result is 1, the PRX gate is applied. If it is 0, an identity gate of similar time
    duration gate is applied instead.
    The measurement instruction must precede the classically controlled gate instruction in the quantum circuit.

    CZ
    --

    Controlled-Z gate. Represented in the standard computational basis by the matrix

    .. math:: \text{CZ} = \text{diag}(1, 1, 1, -1).

    It is symmetric wrt. the qubits it's acting on, and takes no arguments.

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Example

        Instruction(name='cz', qubits=('alice', 'bob'), args={})

    MOVE
    ----

    The MOVE operation is a unitary population exchange operation between a qubit and a resonator.
    Its effect is only defined in the invariant subspace :math:`S = \text{span}\{|00\rangle, |01\rangle, |10\rangle\}`,
    where it swaps the populations of the states :math:`|01\rangle` and :math:`|10\rangle`.
    Its effect on the orthogonal subspace is undefined.

    MOVE has the following presentation in the subspace :math:`S`:

    .. math:: \text{MOVE}_S = |00\rangle \langle 00| + a |10\rangle \langle 01| + a^{-1} |01\rangle \langle 10|,

    where :math:`a` is an undefined complex phase that is canceled when the MOVE gate is applied a second time.

    To ensure that the state of the qubit and resonator has no overlap with :math:`|11\rangle`, it is
    recommended that no single qubit gates are applied to the qubit in between a
    pair of MOVE operations.

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Example

        Instruction(name='move', qubits=('alice', 'resonator'), args={})

    .. note:: MOVE is only available in quantum computers with the IQM Star architecture.

    Barrier
    -------

    A barrier instruction affects the physical execution order of the instructions elsewhere in the
    circuit that act on qubits spanned by the barrier.
    It ensures that any such instructions that succeed the barrier are only executed after
    all such instructions that precede the barrier have been completed.
    Hence it can be used to guarantee a specific causal order for the other instructions.
    It takes no arguments, and has no other effect.

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: Example

        Instruction(name='barrier', qubits=('alice', 'bob'), args={})

    .. note::

       One-qubit barriers will not have any effect on circuit's compilation and execution. Higher layers
       that sit on top of IQM Client can make actual use of one-qubit barriers (e.g. during circuit optimization),
       therefore having them is allowed.
