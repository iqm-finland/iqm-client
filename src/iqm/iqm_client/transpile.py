"""Transpiling circuits to IQM devices involving computational resonators.

In the IQM Star architecture, computational resonators are connected to multiple qubits.
A MOVE gate can be used to move the state of a qubit to a connected, empty computational resonator,
and back *to the same qubit*. Additionally, two-component gates like CZ can be applied
between a qubit and a connected resonator, so that effectively the qubit can be made to interact
with other qubits connected to the resonator. However, the resonators cannot be measured,
and no single-qubit gates can be applied on them.

To enable third-party transpilers to work on the IQM Star architecture, we may abstract away the
resonators and replace the real dynamic quantum architecture with a *simplified architecture*.
Specifically, this happens by removing the resonators from the architecture, and for
each resonator ``r``, and for each pair of supported native qubit-resonator (QR) gates
``(G(q1, r), MOVE(q2, r))`` adding the *fictional* gate ``G(q1, q2)`` to the simplified architecture.
This works since the fictional gate can be implemented as the QR gate sequence

::

    G(q1, q2) = [MOVE(q2, r), G(q1, r), MOVE(q2, r)].

This sequence is called a *resolution* of ``G(q1, q2)``.
Currently  we assume all the QR gates (other than MOVE) are symmetric in the sense that

::

    [MOVE(q2, r), G(q1, r), MOVE(q2, r)] = G(q1, q2) = G(q2, q1) = [MOVE(q1, r), G(q2, r), MOVE(q1, r)]

holds. This has the effect of doubling the number of possible resolutions for ``G(q1, q2)`` since
you can reverse the roles of the qubits.

Before a circuit transpiled to a simplified architecture can be executed it must be further
transpiled to the real Star architecture using :func:`transpile_insert_moves`, which will introduce
the resonators, add MOVE gates as necessary to move the states, and convert the fictional two-qubit
gates into real native gates acting on qubit-resonator pairs.

Likewise :func:`transpile_remove_moves` can be used to perform the opposite transformation,
converting a circuit valid for the real Star architecture into an equivalent circuit for the
corresponding simplified architecture, e.g. so that the circuit can be retranspiled or optimized
using third-party tools that do not support the MOVE gate.

Given a :class:`DynamicQuantumArchitecture` for a Star architecture, the corresponding simplified
version can be obtained using :func:`simplify_architecture`.
