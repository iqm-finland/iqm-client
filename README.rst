IQM Client
###########

Client-side Python library for connecting to an `IQM <https://meetiqm.com/>`_ quantum computer.

Installation
============

IQM client is not intended to be used directly by human users. For executing code on an IQM quantum computer,
you can use for example the `Qiskit on IQM <https://iqm-finland.github.io/qiskit-on-iqm/>`_ library.

If you want just this library, though, you can install it from the Python Package Index (PyPI), e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ uv pip install iqm-client

.. note::

    `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ is highly recommended for practical Python environment and package management.

Supplied within the Python package there is an additional `requirements.txt` file containing locked, security scanned
dependencies. The file can be used to constrain installed dependencies either directly from the repo or by
extracting it from the PyPI package.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ uv pip install --constraint requirements.txt iqm-client

Contributing
============

Format your code:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./format

Run the tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./test

Update the requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python update-requirements.py

After this, any changes in the lockfile `requirements.txt` have to be committed.
The script upgrades locked dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` within the given version ranges. However, transitive
dependencies are deliberately not upgraded automatically.

Documentation
=============

Documentation for the latest version is `available online <https://iqm-finland.github.io/iqm-client/>`_. 
You can build documentation for any older version locally by cloning the Git repository, checking out the 
corresponding tag, and running the docs builder. For example, to build the documentation for version ``20.12``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:iqm-finland/iqm-client.git
    $ cd iqm-client
    $ git checkout 20.12
    $ ./docbuild

(Unless you need to build documentation for multiple versions, consider passing ``git clone`` options to
only clone the commit for the specific version tag, e.g. ``--branch 15.4 --depth 1`` for version ``15.4``.
This will be much faster than cloning the full repository, because some large files have been stored
in the commit history.)

``./docbuild`` will build the documentation at ``./build/sphinx/html``. This command requires the ``sphinx`` and
``sphinx-book-theme`` Python packages (see the ``docs`` optional dependency in ``pyproject.toml``); 
you can install the necessary packages with e.g. ``uv pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"``
