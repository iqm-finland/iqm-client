IQM Client
###########

Client-side Python library for connecting to an `IQM <https://meetiqm.com/>`_ quantum computer.

Installation
============

IQM client is not intended to be used directly by human users. For executing code on an IQM quantum computer,
you can use for example the `Qiskit on IQM <https://iqm-finland.github.io/qiskit-on-iqm/>`_ library.

If you want just this library, though, you can install it from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install iqm-client
